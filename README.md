# Aerospike Fan

A bladeless fan powered by Bambu Lab X1 toolhead turbo.

## What is aerospike

Or to be specific, what is aerospike nozzle? 

## Principle

Same as a regular "bladeless fan", this aerospike fan uses below principle to move air: 

> blowing a thin high-velocity smooth airflow from a continuous slot across the surface of the tube or toroid.

The difference is that the aerospike can generate a narrow and high velocity stream of air, but the regular bladeless is focus on moving large volume of air. 

However, aerospike nozzle is for hypersonic airflow which normally seem in jet engine and rocket engine to adapt wide range of atmosphere pressure (altitude). It can maintain high efficiency because the half of the engine nozzle is the external atmosphere pressure, so the exhaust expansion rate is compensated automatically. 

**How it is benefit to the fan?**

The answer is, no it isnt. 

1. The fan is working in sea level i.e. my desktop..and never changed. The adaptability of aerospike nozzle is useless.

2. A single high velocity stream can move less air than a regular bladeless fan. 

3. The small area of the spike also means that it wont be able to suck enough air. 

**Difficulties**

1. Fan, air pressure and exhaust speed are hard to design and simulate. 

2. Air flow is invisible, not sure how hard is it to keep the exhaust air flow steady.
